# Global Analysis and SSA

Finished dominance utilies in `dominance.py`.  

Pass sys.stdin parameter:
 - `dom`: print dominators for each basic block.
 - `dom_tree`: print a mapping from each node to its children nores in the dominator tree
 - `dom_frontier`: print domination frontier for each basic block.

SSA has not finished yet. I fell off my bike last Saturday and got fracture on my left foot. 
I got several doctor appointments these days. Sorry about it... I'll fill in SSA code later.
